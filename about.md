I have been writing Python code, sometimes as a hobby and often professionally since 1998. I have served as lead architect for projects at UNC Chapel Hill and now at Teamworks, and as a senior or principal developer on others. I've been technical co-founder on a couple of startups as well.

I enjoy designing systems for scale, and organizing people around building the design. I especially like overhauling MVPs or prototypes and making them into scalable systems. "Rebuilding the engine while it's running" is a challenge that excites me right now. 

Outside of work, I like hiking, biking, and just generally being where there are hills and rocks and trees and water. I live in Durham, North Carolina in a tiny patch of woods with my polymath librarian partner, a remarkably unintelligent white cat, an orange cat who thinks the world is his friend, and two Manxes that are Trouble in the shape of furry bowling balls.
